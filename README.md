FTC Team 26651 Code Repository
=

This is the code repository of FTC team 26651, the LoCo Lions. In our code, we prioritise efficient, reliabile and easy-to-write code following best practices. Some noteable things include the seperation of each year's code, as well as a [`core`](https://github.com/FTC-26651/FtcRobotController/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/core) library for non-year specific code. We also use external libraries for efficient coding that follows best practices.
